module Clacky
  # Built-in model provider presets
  # Provides default configurations for supported AI model providers
  module Providers
    # Provider preset definitions
    # Each preset includes:
    # - name: Human-readable provider name
    # - base_url: Default API endpoint
    # - api: API type (anthropic-messages, openai-responses, openai-completions)
    # - default_model: Recommended default model
    # - capabilities (optional): provider-level capability hash (e.g.
    #   { "vision" => false }). Applies to all models under this provider
    #   unless overridden by model_capabilities below.
    # - model_capabilities (optional): per-model capability override map,
    #   { "<model_name>" => { "<cap>" => bool, ... } }. Use this when a
    #   single provider hosts models with different capabilities (e.g.
    #   openclacky hosts both vision-capable Claude and text-only DeepSeek).
    # - model_api_overrides (optional): per-model API-type override map,
    #   { <Regexp|String> => "anthropic-messages" | "openai-completions" | ... }.
    #   Keys can be a plain model name or a Regexp matched against the model.
    #   The first key that matches wins; if none match, the provider's top-level
    #   "api" is used. Used so e.g. OpenRouter can keep "openai-responses" as
    #   its default while routing Claude models through the native Anthropic
    #   endpoint (which preserves cache_control fidelity).

      # Not generalised to other providers: the `sk-...` prefix is used by
      # OpenAI, DeepSeek, Moonshot, and many others, so it can't uniquely
